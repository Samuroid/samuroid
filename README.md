### Hi there 👋

**Samuroid/samuroid** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ personal repo portfolio as a Frontend web developer in Northwest England.

:bowtie: :computer:

- 🔭  2 years of experience - Shopify theme customisation
- 🌱  I’m learning to be a better writer and communicator
- 👯  I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are fun and creative
- 💬  Ask me about how to improve your website User Interface and User Experience
-  ⚡  Fun fact: I skateboard and ride aggressive rollerblades


#### How did I get into Web Dev?

I saw a niche market in a multi-massive online chatting community (MMOCC) game called Habbo Hotel in the early 2000s and decided to create fansites for myself and other players. I designed, coded and hosted their websites and provided shoutcast radios so that visitors could enjoy music whilst exploring webpage content.

#### What is the most important thing to me?

Simplification, Fun, Helping others and Skating.
