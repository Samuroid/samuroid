#### How did I get into Web Dev?

An online game in the early 2000s that motivated me to create fansites for myself and other players! I designed, coded and hosted their websites and provided shoutcast radios so that visitors could enjoy music whilst exploring content.

#### What is the most important thing to me?

Simplification, Fun, Helping others and Skating.
